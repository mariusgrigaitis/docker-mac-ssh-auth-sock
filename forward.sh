# This is where the UGLY hack starts
#
# Problem: if you do: docker run -v $SSH_AUTH_SOCK:$SSH_AUTH_SOCK container
# you get a socket file which is mounted over osxfs from Mac host.
# This socket file can't be reused or removed because it would make ssh commands on
# host machine to not work
#
# Solution:
# 1. connect to VM over special tty channel
# 2. create an empty directory
# 3. bind mount that empty directory over $SSH_AUTH_SOCK directory
# 4. Profit
#
# This makes other docker containers see the created directory instead of osxfs mounted one.
# It also allows to create socket file under same path that does not collide with host one.
# Command is sent over special tty channel to Docker for Mac VM and does not check for errors, etc
# meaning it could be very "unreliable"

# On host machine it connects to $SSH_AUTH_SOCK socket and pipes output to stdout, takes input from stdin
# On docker VM it launches a container running socat, which creates a socket file under $SSH_AUTH_SOCK path, accepts
# input and forwards it to stdout/stdin
# socat running on host machine connects stdin/stdout between those two sockets can communicate over stdin/stdout
#
# This is not really reliable because forwarding input/output over stdin/stdout does not allow for multiple communications
# at the same time. It fails when doing multiple connections to $SSH_AUTH_SOCK at the same time.
